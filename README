Overview

bashapp takes as input a bash script and generates a binary executable and OS X
application directory structure. This allows developers to provide Finder clickable
bash scripts without terminals popping up, etc. Useful for launch, service scripts,
etc.

It also provides simple source encryption as a means to obfuscate the bash script.


Compiling

Type the following command in the Terminal to compile

gcc bashapp.c -o bashapp


Using bashapp

Usage: bashapp PATH_TO_BASH_SCRIPT APPNAME [KEY]

E.g.

  Create 'MyApp' with your own key:
  bashapp script.sh MyApp s#ZcrE33t
