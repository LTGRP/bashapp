Overview

bashapp takes as input a bash script and generates a binary executable and OS X
application directory structure. This allows developers to provide Finder clickable
bash scripts without terminals popping up, etc. Useful for launch, service scripts,
etc.

It also provides simple source encryption as a means to obfuscate the bash script.
You can specify your own key, or let bashapp generate a randomly sized random key for
you, no fewer than 32 bytes long.

(Note: it's recommended to let bashap create the key for you since every time you
compile, it will create a new, pseudo-randomly generated value of variable length.)


Compiling

Type the following command in the Terminal to compile

gcc bashapp.c -o bashapp


Using bashapp

Usage: bashapp PATH_TO_BASH_SCRIPT APPNAME [KEY]

E.g.

  Create 'MyApp' with the default encryption key:
  bashapp script.sh MyApp

  Create 'MyApp' with your own key:
  bashapp script.sh MyApp s#ZcrE33t
